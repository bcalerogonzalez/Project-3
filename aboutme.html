          <p> These are some of the things I like to do. I am very passionate about nature and my studies. But all my drive and motivation come from God, family and friends. besides my education as a civilian I am also part of the military and I want to become a 2LT in the US Army. I made a promise to my grandfather to become the first one in my family with a Master's degree so I do not have the luxury to fail. I want to make him and my mother proud I also want to be an example to my brothers and cousins. After I graduate and I have a career I would like to start helping others in PR with projects and providing more career oportunities in the island.</p>
